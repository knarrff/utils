# This script is intended to remove sheet-protection from MS Excel files
# without knowing the password. This is "ok", since this feature is not
# meant to keep anything secret anyway (nothing is encrypted), but is only
# meant to avoid accidental overwrites.
# More specifically, it was written because (at least at the time of writing
# this) libreoffice could not remove the protection without the password, or
# in this case when an empty password was provided for the specific files I
# had to deal with - and also because protecting the sheets meant that
# formulae I wanted to see were hidden as well.
