# This can be used, e.g., as part of the shell prompt, to not display the
# full path (may be longer than a line), but shorten it as much as
# uniquely possible:
# 
# For bash: instead of '\w' within $PS1, use
#    '$(pwd | /PATH_TO_BIN/inverse_glob.py)'
# 
# Note that this will result in more file lookups within all parent paths
# every time this is executed, i.e., every time you get a new prompt. This
# means this can be quite slow if your current directory is inside a slow
# network mount, for exampe.
# I use the following to exclude filesystems I know are slow. This may not
# be the best method though, and likely will need tweaking on your part to
# work for you:
# 
# '$(if stat -f -c %T "`pwd`" | grep -q fuseblk; then pwd; else pwd | /PATH_TO_BIN/inverse_glob.py; fi)'
